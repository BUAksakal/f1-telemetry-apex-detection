# f1-telemetry-apex-detection
Advanced F1 telemetry visualization tool that automatically detects real apex points using curvature and speed-derivative analysis. For each corner, the system identifies the fastest driver, colors the apex in the corresponding team color, and renders a stylized neon circuit map with a marked start/finish line. Built with Fast-F1, SciPy and Plotly.
